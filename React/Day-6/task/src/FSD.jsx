      <p>
        A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the
        front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a
        website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the
        behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill
        sets.
      </p>
    </div>
